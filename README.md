## Description

This is a repo for my Projext Exam 1 at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media. “Tasty Vibes” is a conceptual blog dedicated to culinary enthusiasts, crafted over a five-week period. This project required us to design and develop a website from the ground up, incorporating WordPress as a headless CMS to manage the blog posts. The site is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, showcasing the skills I’ve learned in my first year.

#### Brief in short
You have been tasked with creating a blog site. You can choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it should have at least the following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

## Built With

The site is built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5)
